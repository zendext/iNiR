## [2.25.0] - 2026-05-16

2.25 is the desktop widgets release. They finally work — edit mode, custom widgets, resize, persistence, the whole thing. The color pipeline got its biggest architectural change in a while with app-palette, and the shell now actually reads the wallpaper to pick text colors instead of guessing. Also, Steam theming moved to Millennium because Adwaita for Steam is dead.

### Added
- **Desktop widgets v2**: complete rewrite of the widget system. Edit mode with a manager panel, IPC-driven config persistence, resize handles, zone placement, custom widget pipeline with a real SDK (`setSource` for required props, schema key declaration), and popover chips redesigned with `SelectionGroupButton` + `GridLayout`. Fixed approximately 15 critical bugs along the way — VME segfaults, stale-text config overwrites, loader feedback loops, edit controls eating their own clicks, widgets spawning at top-left, zone placement breaking on resize. The kind of PR that needs therapy afterward.
- **Audio visualizer desktop widget**: waveform/spectrum visualizer as a background desktop widget. Configurable type and position across all presets.
- **App palette** (`app-palette.json`): semantic intermediate color layer between raw Material You tokens and external apps. Provides contrast-safe tokens (`app_background`, `app_surface`, `app_headerbar_bg`, `app_selection`, `app_border_subtle`, etc.) derived from M3 surface/primary with readable-contrast enforcement (WCAG 4.5:1 minimum). All shell/python theming modules (GTK, Chrome, Spicetify, editors, Zed, Pear Desktop, SDDM, terminals, system24) and matugen templates now prefer app-palette with graceful fallback.
- **Brightness-aware widget text**: desktop widgets analyze the actual wallpaper region behind them (grayscale average) to pick light/dark text with accent tinting, instead of relying on the global dark/light mode. New `--color-only` mode in the image analysis script does position-aware color without the full region search. Widgets re-analyze on drag end and wallpaper change.
- **Recording OSD redesign**: redesigned Recorder widget with a real timer, status bar, and game mode section. Auto-hide behavior with `Mod+Shift+R` keybind. Multi-indicator support with `mediaEnabled` toggle. MediaIndicator and MediaOSD layout polished.
- **Clipboard navigate mode**: keyboard navigation in the clipboard panel. HTML display cleanup, copy operation preserves cursor position. Also added HTML and Unicode sanitization helpers so pasted content doesn't inject garbage.
- **Sidebar requested-widget navigation**: any component can now request a specific sidebar tab by type (e.g. `"notepad"`) through `GlobalStates.sidebarRightRequestedWidget` without reaching into Persistent state. Both sidebar layouts listen and switch accordingly. Bar notepad button uses this instead of hardcoded tab indices.
- **Notepad context menu**: right-click context menu in the notepad widget, themed selection colors, and persistent selection so you don't lose your highlight when the sidebar loses focus.

### Changed
- **Steam theming moved to Millennium**: Adwaita for Steam is deprecated; theming now goes through Millennium's Material-Theme plugin. Updated translations across all locales.
- **Aurora configurable glass transparency**: style editor now exposes glass opacity. Fixed live reactivity that was broken because Config.revision wasn't being used as a dependency.
- **Doctor TUI overhaul**: animated steps with palette-aware badges, dot threshold, tagline centering. All deps now required (wlsunset added). Font list cleanup. Quickconfig buttons theme-adaptive. Compact output.
- **switchwall performance**: batched 24 individual jq config reads into a single mapfile call (62ms → 3ms). Integrated scheme auto-detection into `generate_colors_material.py` (eliminates separate process spawn, saves ~585ms). Net: ~904ms → ~760ms per wallpaper change.
- **Wallpaper selector performance**: eliminated per-item `magick identify` spawn (thundering herd — N concurrent magick processes on directory open). Lowered thumbnail size from 512px to 256px (4x less memory). Increased batch workers from 1 to 4. Removed per-item OpacityMask FBO.
- **applycolor module runner**: replaced unbounded fork-all with a sliding window (nproc/2, capped at 4) using `ionice -c 3` + `nice -n 10`. New manifest-based enablement skips disabled targets entirely instead of spawning them to self-exit.
- **Dock shadow opacity**: per dark/light mode tuning (0.18/0.35) with spread reset for cleaner appearance.

### Fixed
- **Dock stale toplevel ghost entries**: NiriService window matching could produce false matches on zero-score entries, and `sortedToplevels` could contain stale compositor entries not present in live ToplevelManager. Both now guarded.
- **Preset theme colors not propagating to external apps** *(#144)*: `FileView.setText()` dropped async writes when `applyPreset()` fired 2-3x rapidly on startup. Replaced 6 FileView instances with a single debounced bash script that writes all generated files atomically. Also added `kde-cli-tools` as a dependency and doctor check — required for Dolphin's "Open With" dialog when `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde`.
- **VSCode theme not live-reloading on wallpaper change**: file watcher wasn't triggering on the generated palette update.
- **Media artwork sync across shell**: shared resolver now correctly drives all surfaces.
- **Sidebar dynamic padding and angel border**: restored when the border-disable flag was set.
- **Audio mic mute/volume**: backed with `wpctl` instead of unreliable QML PipeWire bindings for the mic path.
- **Booru providers**: waifu.im tag search (case sensitivity), t.alcy.cc fixes, `/toggle-tags` behavior, zerochan rating filter.
- **Recording OSD HoverHandler crash**: undefined `hovered` access.
- **OSD hotZone behavior**: removed autoHideHotZone, keep mask on pill at all times.
- **Notification popup card shadows**: removed shadow that was visually incorrect on transparent backgrounds.
- **Overview dashboard weather layout**: Material 3 chips with Flow layout instead of broken grid.
- **Screenshot clipboard pollution**: previews no longer pollute the clipboard with intermediate screenshot data.
- **Opus audio codec options**: clarified labels in Settings UI.
- **Translation generation hitting ARG_MAX** *(#140)*: `gemini-translate.sh` passed the full `en_US.json` (~228 KB) as a shell argument, exceeding the kernel's 128 KB per-argument limit. Refactored to use jq `--rawfile` and pipe payload to curl via stdin.

## [2.24.0] - 2026-04-30

2.24 is a practical one: screen recording got real controls, keyboard indicators stopped being noisy, media players behave across ii and waffle, and the update flow is finally visible instead of doing spooky background theater.

### Added
- **Settings UI Easy Mode**: optional curated mode that hides 7 advanced pages from the nav rail (Background, Tools, Services, Advanced, Modules, Waffle Style, Compositor) and trims expert-only sections inside the remaining pages. New `settingsUi.easyMode` config key, opt-in via the title-bar toggle (school/tune icon) in both overlay and window settings, also surfaced in Modules → Settings UI. Search results filter to essentials too. Fresh users pick Easy or Advanced on the welcome wizard. Default Advanced — nobody's existing layout shifts on update.
- **Welcome wizard refresh**: 5 steps got a polish pass. Step 1 gains a "What you'll dial in" preview card (Theme & wallpaper / Layout / Features / Tips) so users see value before they decide to skip. Skip button moved to a top-right ghost link with a tooltip pointing at `inir welcome` so it's recoverable. Step indicator gets per-circle labels and a "Step X of N" counter, past circles are clickable to jump back. Features step expanded with weather widget, bar auto-hide, time-format selector (system/24h/12h) and show-seconds toggle. Ready step replaces the CLI tip card with a "Try it now" action card (pick wallpaper, test notification, show shortcuts cheatsheet, open quick settings — all one-click via existing IPC), and the troubleshooting callout is now a clickable card linking to the wiki guide. Wizard surface uses `colLayer1Base` so Material/Cards styles stay solid even with content transparency on.
- **`inir welcome` CLI**: re-runs the welcome wizard. For users who skipped on first run and now want to flip Easy/Advanced or replay the Try-it-now actions. Reuses the same launch lock pattern as `inir settings-window`.
- **Terminal-visible shell updates**: clicking Update on the iNiR update overlay now launches `setup` in the user's configured terminal (resolved via `AppLauncher.commandFor("terminal")`, falls back to kitty) so the full TUI is visible — progress lines, success/warn/error banners, the snapshot ID, dependency checks, the lot. Output is also tee'd to `update.log` for the diagnostics flow. Auto-closes on success, pauses with "Press Enter to close" on failure so the error doesn't disappear in a flash. Toggle in Settings → Services → "Open terminal during update" or `shellUpdates.openTerminalOnUpdate` in config.json. Default on, off restores the previous silent-background behavior.
- **Animated update phase indicator**: every step in `setup update` now shows a dot row (●●●◉○○○), the step counter `[N/7]`, and either a braille spinner (atomic ops like the git pull, migrations, and shell restart) or a clean header followed by the existing verbose output (file sync, dependency check, python venv). Each spinner step ends with `✓ msg (Xs)` so the elapsed time is visible. Falls back to plain static lines when the output isn't a TTY (e.g. piped to a log file). New helpers `tui_step_start` / `tui_step_done` / `tui_step_fail` / `tui_step_warn` / `tui_step_skip` in `sdata/lib/tui.sh` and `_step_phase_start` / `_step_phase_done` / `_step_phase_header` wrappers in `setup` that write the same `update-status` markers as before.
- **`setup update --simulate`**: walks the seven update phases with the new TUI visuals, sleeps in place of the real ops, writes the same status markers as the real flow. No git pull, no rsync, no migrations, no shell restart — useful for previewing the visuals or exercising the resume-from-status-file logic without touching the install. Shows a "Simulation mode" banner and a final elapsed-time summary. Aliased as `--dry-run`.
- **OSK keep-on-top toggle** *(#135)*: new toolbar button on the on-screen keyboard. When enabled, the OSK re-stacks above launcher / sidebars / overview / settings / etc. as those overlays open, via a brief wlr-layer-shell remap. Default off. Requested by ImDarkos.
- **Bluetooth device-aware icons**: bar, verticalBar and sidebar quick toggles now show a Material Symbol that matches the connected device — headphones, keyboard, mouse, smartphone, watch, gamepad, printer, and friends. Falls back to the generic glyph for unknown devices. Same treatment in the waffle family via the existing `bluetoothDeviceIcon` helper.
- **YAMIS monochrome iconset as an extra**: dirn-typo's `yet-another-monochrome-icon-set` (GPL-3, ~23 MiB). Cloned in user scope, never overrides the active icon theme — pick it from Settings → Appearance → Icon theme. Default-on for fresh installs (auto on `-y`), available via `./setup extras` for existing users, ff-pulled on update if already installed.
- **`inir colorpicker` CLI**: top-level command for the wallpaper color picker, documented alongside the rest of the CLI.
- **Keyboard status indicators across ii and waffle**: Caps Lock, Num Lock, and layout changes now have native shell popups plus compact bar/taskbar indicators, backed by the shared layout service and kernel LED state instead of compositor-specific hacks. Settings live in Settings → General → Time and Waffle Settings → General → Time & Language. Num Lock is available but defaults off now, because keyboards love lying about it on startup.
- **Date format controls finally exposed in settings**: long and short date formats are now editable in both settings families, so clocks can use locale-friendly patterns like `dddd, MMMM dd` without hand-editing config files. The vertical bar keeps its compact numeric day/month display instead of exploding on free-form short-date formats.
- **Screen recording presets and encoder controls**: Settings → Tools → Screen recording and Waffle Settings → Interface → Screen recording now expose quality presets, acceleration mode, fallback behavior, codec, FPS, bitrate, CRF, encoder speed, pixel format, audio codec/source/backend/sample rate, and detected encoder capability. The recorder probes `ffmpeg`, audio sources, render devices, VAAPI/NVENC availability, and picks safer defaults instead of assuming one GPU path fits every machine. Bold strategy avoided.
- **Discord-ready recording compression**: optional post-recording compression creates a separate shareable copy while keeping the original untouched. Target size, max dimension, encoder speed, audio bitrate, and "only if needed" controls live under the same recording settings in both settings families. The compressor uses two-pass H.264 budgeting with a safety margin for Discord's 10/25/50 MB limits, so long clips stop becoming accidental file-transfer boss fights.

### Changed
- **Audio mic via PipeWire native**: removed the 2s `wpctl` polling for mic state and now reads/writes through QS PipeWire bindings directly. Sink-side `wpctl` paths kept as a defensive fallback for USB / device-route edge cases.
- **Standalone-window environment isolation**: settings, waffleSettings, welcome and killDialog now use `INIR_STANDALONE_WINDOW=1` instead of piggybacking on `QS_NO_RELOAD_POPUP`. Fixes the main shell being incorrectly identified as a settings process — which suppressed reload toasts and skipped external theme application. Standalone windows also disable file watching now (single-shot UI doesn't need hot-reload).
- **Keyboard layout handling on Niri**: layout availability now comes from `niri msg -j keyboard-layouts`, so the switcher and panel indicator only show when there is actually more than one layout. The bar spacing also collapses when no keyboard indicators are visible.

### Fixed
- **Media artwork updates across all players**: the shared resolver now drives ii, waffle, overview, sidebars, lock screens, OSDs, control panel, and media popup presets. It keys cache files by artwork URL plus title/artist/album, keeps the current art visible while the next image resolves, cache-busts local `file://` display sources so Qt actually reloads them, and refuses empty cache files. Yes, Qt still needed convincing that the same path can contain new pixels.
- **Plasma Browser Integration / YouTube artwork flashing**: browser-provided temp art like `/tmp/plasma-browser-integration_artwork_*.jpg` is copied into iNiR's cover-art cache before being shown. When Plasma deletes the temp file, the player no longer flashes back to the fallback icon like it got jump-scared.
- **Media controls using one real control path**: bar clicks, vertical bar clicks, sidebars, overview, control panel, lock media, waffle widgets, waffle action center, waffle lock, OSDs, and media popup presets now route previous/next/toggle through `MprisController`. That gives normal MPRIS, YtMusic, and filtered active-player selection the same behavior everywhere, instead of each widget inventing its own tiny chaos engine.
- **YouTube previous/next when Plasma says "nah"**: on Niri, browser YouTube players can fall back to focusing the matching browser window, sending YouTube's Shift+P / Shift+N shortcuts through `wtype`, then restoring focus. It is guarded behind Niri, `wtype`, a matching browser window, and an unlocked session; lock screens won't start steering random browser windows because that would be unhinged.
- **Manual media player selection in the compact sidebar**: selecting another player now survives playback-state churn until that player disappears. The player switcher also uses the default context-menu delegate again, so switching does not depend on a broken `type: "item"` model entry.
- **Media buttons pretending unavailable actions exist**: previous/next buttons now bind to the same capability checks as the controller, including the browser fallback. If a player cannot go next, the UI stops putting on a little theater performance.
- **Media popup startup crash**: `PlayerBase` owns its `Connections` objects as properties now, avoiding the `Cannot assign to non-existent default property` crash from loose `Connections` inside a `QtObject`.
- **Non-waffle media players picking the wrong browser/MPRIS duplicate for cover art**: sidebar, media popup presets, control panel, overview, lock screen, and volume mixer now follow the same deduped active-player selection as the bar popup, so they use the art-capable entry instead of the empty sibling.
- **Shared media cover art flashing back to the fallback icon during track changes**: ii/shared players now keep valid art visible while rechecking/downloading, skip empty-path retries, and ignore aborted checker/downloader exits.
- **Bar resources stuck at "100% memory, 0% rest" until the sidebar opened**: `ResourceUsage.qml` defaulted `memoryTotal=1` with no zero-guard, so the percentage binding evaluated to 100% before the first poll. The poll waited a full `updateInterval` (3s) and `FileView.text()` returned empty on that first call anyway. Now `ensureRunning()` primes `_pollSensors()` synchronously and initial totals start at `0` with a percentage guard.
- **Quickshell grabbing the NVIDIA dGPU on hybrid laptops** *(#136, [discussion #133](https://github.com/snowarch/iNiR/discussions/133))*: even with `resources.monitorGpu=false` skipping the polling (#106), the Vulkan loader still `dlopen`'d `libnvidia-*` during device enumeration, opening the `/dev/nvidia*` fds visible in the issue's lsof. New `apply_gpu_policy()` in the launcher detects hybrid via DRM `boot_vga` and, when the toggle is off, sets `VK_LOADER_DRIVERS_DISABLE=*nvidia*`, `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT=pci-<iGPU>`, `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=mesa`, `__VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=non_NVIDIA_only`, `VDPAU_DRIVER=none`, and a few related vars before `QGuiApplication` initialises. One Settings toggle controls both halves. Hard opt-out: `INIR_GPU_FORCE_DEFAULT=1`.
- **Hot-reload SIGSEGV**: shipped Quickshell upstream patch (`patches/quickshell/fix-extension-uaf.patch`) moves extension deletion in `EngineGeneration::destroy()` to after root destruction, fixing the use-after-free in `IpcHandlerRegistry`. Also added `QS_DISABLE_CRASH_HANDLER=1` to the systemd unit so failed reloads stop dumping ~1 MB crash reports into `~/.cache/quickshell/crashes/` on every iteration.
- **Duplicate settings / welcome instances on rapid keypress**: `flock` guard in `open_detached_qml_window()`.
- **Token compliance across settings UI**: hardcoded white / black / orange replaced with the matching token (`colOnLayer0`, `Looks.colors.fg`, `colWarning`). Spinbox schedule never saving (wrong signal name) and disabled toggles rendering as checked are also fixed in the same pass.
- **Material lock screen red-screen artifact on Niri**: material lock kept three legacy `FastBlur` paths (Image, AnimatedImage, Video) alive in the QML tree even when the safe `MultiEffect` pipeline was the actual renderer. Some GPU drivers fail to compile the FastBlur shader and leak a red buffer through, even on invisible items. Switched material lock to the same source → `MultiEffect` shape waffle already used, then gated `source` and `layer.enabled` of the FastBlur paths on `!useSafeBlurPipeline` so they go fully inert on Niri. Hyprland behavior unchanged.
- **Session sleep crashing the shell**: the lock-before-sleep flow had a broken sleep path that took down `inir.service` whenever the system tried to suspend with the lockscreen on. Suspend requests now go through the shared `Session` flow; hibernate visibility kept honest.
- **Color generation firing 2-3× per action, apps coming out washed**: three overlapping bugs. `ThemeService.onReadyChanged` reset the live-regen signature on every Quickshell instance — including the standalone settings window — firing a phantom `regenerateAutoTheme()` on open. Explicit `regenerateAutoTheme()` calls left the debounce primed to fire again ~700 ms later because the signature wasn't synced. And `switchwall.sh` ran `applycolor.sh` internally while the shell's `MaterialThemeLoader` watcher ran it again on the same `colors.json` change — two parallel module waves racing each other through GTK / chromium / spicetify / pear-desktop. Now the signature primes up front, `setAutoRegenTimer` routes through `regenerateAutoTheme`, and the script-side `applycolor.sh` is gone — `theming_modules.log` shows one run per user action instead of 8-12+ per second.
- **Settings overlay → window mode toggle was a no-op**: clicking "Window" in the material settings overlay flipped `overlayMode` then started a 500 ms timer to launch `inir settings-window`. The `LazyLoader` in `shell.qml` unloads the overlay component the instant `overlayMode` flips — including that timer. Spawn never fired. Now mirrors the window→overlay shape: spawn first (process survives the QML scope), then close.
- **Updater treating diverged branches like routine pulls**: prerelease VMs and local-dev checkouts could be reset to the remote without warning. The flow now classifies behind / up-to-date / ahead / diverged separately and refuses destructive recovery on diverged branches.
- **`setup` and `doctor` reporting vague maintenance guesses**: both commands and the launcher now show the actual repo checkout, launcher path, and service state. The repair help path stops dumping users into generic usage text.
- **`screen-off` respecting idle inhibitors**: any app keeping the session awake (browsers playing audio, mpv, video calls) prevented the timeout from firing. Screen-off now keys off user input only; lock and suspend keep the inhibitor-respecting default. Power on/off routes through `CompositorService` IPC for free Hyprland support and surfaced failures.
- **Duplicate `hideWhenFullscreen` key in waffles.background defaults**: copy-paste leak after the backdrop block. Both occurrences were `true` so behavior was unchanged, but JSON parsers warned and any future divergence would have silently lost one assignment.
- **Update progress display vanishing after the shell restart mid-update**: clicking the bar's update indicator opened the overlay, clicking Update kicked off `setup update` detached, and once the script reached step 7 (`systemctl --user restart inir.service`) the new shell instance came up with `isUpdating=false`. The bar X/7 indicator stopped, the overlay didn't reopen, and the user was left wondering whether the update was running or wedged. `ShellUpdates.qml` now reads `update-status` 1s after init: in-flight `progress:N:M:msg` markers (N < M) restore `isUpdating`, step/total/message and resume the existing poller + watchdog so the bar pill resumes counting; final-step markers (N >= M) are treated as completed and cleared; `success` is cleared as stale state; `failed:N` surfaces `lastError` and clears so it doesn't replay every restart.
- **Bar update popup content looking shifted/off-center**: `ShellUpdateIndicator` had the popup `ColumnLayout` attached directly as `StyledPopup` content but not centered in the popup background, so rows hugged the top-left and looked offset relative to the card. It now uses the same `anchors.centerIn: parent` pattern as the other bar popups (battery/resources), so content lands where it's supposed to.
- **Settings Easy/Advanced mode tooltip being both too wide and backwards**: the title-bar mode toggle tooltip near the top-right controls could spill off-screen, and the later copy tweak still described the current state instead of the action, which was just rude. The tooltip now opens to the left and says what the click actually does: switch to Easy mode or switch to Advanced mode. Also removed the redundant Easy pill badge from the overlay header since the top-right toggle already does the job.
- **Update terminal closing immediately on success**: the terminal launched for `setup update` would vanish the instant the update finished, giving nobody a chance to read what happened. Now stays open with a short summary and waits for the user to close it manually.
- **Dock hover-reveal trigger grabbing the whole screen edge**: when the dock was hidden in hover-reveal mode, the reveal `MouseArea` could stretch into a giant invisible edge strip instead of matching the dock footprint. The hitbox now uses the real dock width/height and only the anchors needed for the current edge, so reveal tracks the dock area instead of some random side of the monitor.

## [2.23.0] - 2026-04-25

Calendar sync landed, the wiki got a proper bulk update, YT Music stopped being weird about pasted URLs, and text inputs finally learned the ancient art of right click.

### Added
- **Calendar sync across the shell**: external ICS/iCal feeds now have a real runtime path instead of "maybe someday". Added `CalendarSync` service, pure-JS ICS parsing, cache/state wiring, ii calendar day-detail view, waffle calendar event integration, merged external events in the Events tab, and settings UI for both panel families.
- **Bigger docs pass**: added a proper wiki/doc set for architecture, runtime, modules, services, panel families, wallpaper, theming presets, audio/media, autostart, global actions, and compositor behavior. Also added dedicated calendar integration docs.
- **YT Music URL flow that behaves like a normal app**: pasted YouTube, YouTube Music, and Spotify URLs now resolve inline in the sidebar instead of silently doing random background stuff. Single tracks get metadata before playback, playlists populate visible results, and direct music.youtube links resolve correctly.
- **Text input context menus**: shared right-click menus now exist for the shell's text fields and text areas across settings, ii widgets, waffle text fields, and the YT Music sidebar. Undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/select-all, no mystery meat.

### Fixed
- **Arch install dependency drift** *(#128)*: `eza` is now included in the Arch dependency lists, so the default alias setup stops pointing users at a command that was never installed.
- **Updater stuck forever on "Updating..."** *(#129)*: early-success paths now write success state before returning, so package-managed or already-updated installs stop pretending they're still mid-flight.
- **Chrome policy spam on Linux** *(#131)*: dropped the unsupported `BrowserColorScheme` enterprise policy instead of feeding Chrome a setting it just rejects.
- **SDDM on Qt 6** *(#127)*: switched the theme import to use `qt5compat`, which is what SDDM actually expects in that environment.
- **YT Music related-mix queue race**: related mixes now ignore stale resolver output from the previous track instead of quietly building the next playlist from the wrong song.
- **Shared text input i18n regression**: the new context menu labels now go through `Translation.tr()` instead of hardcoding English inside a common widget.

### Changed
- **Release hygiene**: versioned project metadata was bumped together across docs, Arch packaging, and installer fallback paths.
- **Release helper script**: added `scripts/release.sh` to extract notes from `CHANGELOG.md` and drive the tag/release step without hand-copying markdown every time.

## [2.22.1] - 2026-04-22

Hotfix round. Half the install pipeline was quietly broken and nobody noticed because existing users don't re-install. Fresh CachyOS users noticed though — loudly.

### Added
- **Branch awareness**: non-main branches now visually stand out everywhere — bar update indicator, settings about page, update overlay, `inir version` CLI, and `setup update`. Tertiary-colored hints, no blocking, just so people know they're off the release track.
- **Conflicting shell detection**: install and doctor now detect all known Quickshell-based shells (noctalia, DankMaterialShell, caelestia, bms) and handle removal in the correct order — meta-package first, then shell, then runtime. CachyOS users who picked Niri from the installer no longer have to manually fight package conflicts.

### Fixed
- **20-60 second gray screen on fresh boot**: two `systemctl --user show-environment` D-Bus calls ran sequentially at startup, each blocking 10-30s when the user manager wasn't warm yet. Now cached with a single 3s-timeout call. Worst case dropped from a full minute of staring at nothing to ~3 seconds.
- **Shell never auto-starting on boot**: fresh installs never created the systemd service file. `sync_user_inir_service_from_repo_if_present()` only updates existing files and bails on missing ones. Added a fresh-install code path that creates the service from template.
- **Shell starting on KDE/GNOME** *(again)*: `detect_compositor_service()` still fell back to `graphical-session.target` in several code paths even after 2.22.0's [Install] section removal. KDE activates that target too. Nuked every remaining fallback — if we can't detect your compositor, we refuse to wire the service.
- **Install silently dying at phase 3**: migration 023 had top-level `set -euo pipefail` and `exit 0`. The migration system loads via `source`, so those killed the parent setup process. Everything after migrations never ran. Rewrote to use the standard function pattern.
- **ExecStopPost path wrong on repo-sync installs**: service sync only rewrote `ExecStart`, leaving `ExecStopPost` pointing to `/usr/bin/inir`. Cleanup-orphans failed silently on every shutdown.
- **SDDM theme skipped with `-y`**: non-interactive installs explicitly skipped the SDDM theme. Now installs automatically.
- **Bar resources freezing after 15s**: ResourceUsage auto-stops polling after 15s. The bar never renewed its subscription, so CPU/RAM/temp went stale until you opened a sidebar. Persistent panels now use `keepAlive()`/`releaseKeepAlive()`.
- **Doctor launching duplicate shell**: symlink path vs resolved path mismatch in `qs -p` calls. Now resolves symlinks first.
- **VSCode/Cursor/OpenCode theming broken**: orphaned `strip_neovim_spec()` referencing undefined variable crashed the editors module with `set -euo pipefail`, killing all editor theming.
- **Phantom dock icons for uninstalled apps**: pinned apps with no `.desktop` file (e.g. Firefox on Fedora) no longer show ghost icons. The pin stays in config so the icon comes back if you install the app later.

### Changed
- **Removed stale legacy config**: `dots/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` was a 349-key relic from the end-4 era. Fresh installs always used `defaults/config.json` (856 keys) — the fallback was dead code that would have delivered a broken config if it ever triggered.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-04-21

The "community contributions edition". Turns out people actually use this thing and want to make it better. Who knew.

### Added
- **Lock screen overhaul**: multiple clock styles (default, minimal, analog, binary), configurable position, dim overlay with adjustable opacity, notification icons that expand to show details, on-screen keyboard, grouped notifications by app with count badges. Both ii and waffle families. Full settings UI integration.
- **Recording OSD**: draggable overlay pill that shows elapsed time during screen recording. Collapsed/expanded modes with audio/mic toggles. Glass background for aurora/angel styles. Disabled by default, enable in Settings > Tools > Screen Recording.
- **Chromium theme pipeline**: auto-generates a Chrome/Chromium theme from wallpaper colors, integrated into the color generation pipeline.
- **Recording notification toggle**: suppress start/stop notifications independently from the OSD in settings.

### Fixed
- **Shell starting on KDE/GNOME**: removed `[Install]` section from systemd unit. inir now wires via compositor-specific `.wants/` symlinks instead of `WantedBy=graphical-session.target`. Migration 022 moves existing users.
- **Cursor theme inconsistency across apps**: niri config, gsettings, and `environment.d` could all hold different cursor themes. Changing cursor in settings now syncs all three sources so Electron/XWayland apps match.
- **Animation token misapplication**: 21 animations across 16 files were using `elementMoveEnter` (400ms) instead of `elementMoveFast` (200ms) for fast feedback like popup opacity, hover states, and dock previews. Also fixed a timer interval incorrectly gated by `animationsEnabled`.
- **Systray overflow behavior**: overflow popup was auto-closing while a right-click context menu was still open, orphaning it. Now suppresses auto-close when a menu is active. Also increased the base close timeout from 700ms to 1500ms and the context menu hover grace period to 450ms.
- **Time format not following user preference**: lock screens and sidebar clock now use `DateTime.time` instead of hardcoded `Qt.formatTime`.
- **Qt font clobbered on wallpaper change**: kdeglobals now reads the current gsettings font before writing, preserving user font choice.
- **`inir status` false negative**: setup script wasn't resolving symlinks before passing paths to `qs -p`, so dev setups always reported "not running".
- **Recording notification config ignored**: jq `//` operator treats `false` as falsy, so `false // true` returned `true`. Boolean config reads now use explicit null checks.
- **Notify-send always firing**: bash `&&` binds tighter than `&`, so the is_truthy guard was being backgrounded unconditionally. Switched to if/then/fi.
- **Clipboard duplicates from browsers**: copying from a browser stored both the HTML and plain text versions as separate entries. Switched to type-specific wl-paste watchers (`--type text` and `--type image`) per cliphist upstream recommendation. Migration 023 patches existing users.
- **Single-window auto-expand unreliable**: rewrote from a timer-retry-focus loop into direct event-driven checks from niri window/workspace handlers. No more needing to switch workspaces for it to trigger.

### Changed
- **Animation tokens**: migrated hardcoded animation durations and easing curves across ~30 files to use Appearance design tokens, gated by `animationsEnabled`.
- **Neovim theming**: replaced inline lua generation with external `inir.nvim` plugin via `neovim_themegen.sh`.
- **Systemd hardening**: coredumps disabled (LimitCORE=0), DISPLAY exported to systemd env on start.
- **SDDM service**: enabled during install phase.
- **Audio fallback**: wpctl now falls back to next available sink when USB audio disconnects.
- **Environment bridge**: `ensure_systemd_graphical_env` now exports `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM`, and cursor vars to the systemd session, fixing Electron apps crashing when launched from the shell instead of a terminal.

## [2.21.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Steam notification positioning**: Steam notification toasts now appear at bottom-right corner instead of default position.

### Fixed
- **Systemd service environment race**: `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `NIRI_SOCKET` now properly imported before shell start, preventing Qt XCB fallback and empty socket path crashes on fresh boot.
- **FadeLoader race condition**: Right sidebar and overlay panels could crash during rapid open/close cycles due to component lifecycle timing issues.
- **Applications settings state sync**: Browser selection ComboBox now properly reflects current config value. XDG default browser integration fixed.
- **Wallhaven HTTP requests**: Switched from Qt NetworkAccessManager to curl to bypass User-Agent restrictions that were blocking API requests.
- **Mic slider state sync**: Microphone volume slider and mute state now stay in sync with source changes. Volume persistence fixed across source switches.
- **Bar sidebar hover hitbox**: Sidebar open/close hover detection now scoped to button area only, preventing false triggers from adjacent bar elements.
- **NIRI_SOCKET boot race**: NiriService now waits for valid socket path before attempting connection, eliminating empty path errors on session start.
- **IPC keybind failures at boot**: Grace period bug and missing retry logic caused keybind registration to fail silently during shell startup. Now retries with exponential backoff.

### Improved
- **Documentation audit**: Fixed broken wiki links, updated stale module lists, clarified internal terminology, improved config documentation clarity.
- **Wiki index rendering**: Grid card separators changed from `***` to `---` for proper Material theme rendering.

### Changed
- **Boot-time optimization**: Reduced service initialization contention and hardened maintenance flow error handling.
- **Theming defaults**: Neovim theming disabled by default. Added missing wallpaper theming toggle controls to settings UI.
- **NVIDIA telemetry**: Hybrid dGPU suspend-aware polling, fixed GPU detection on multi-GPU systems *(#106)*.

## [2.21.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **WiFi hotspot toggle**: Shared `HotspotToggle` model (nmcli-based) with SSID, password, and band configuration. ii family gets classic + android toggle styles with `HotspotDialog` and ServicesConfig settings. Waffle family gets ActionCenter toggle with `HotspotControl` panel and settings in WGeneralPage + WModulesPage. Config keys: `hotspot.ssid`, `hotspot.password`, `hotspot.band`.
- **Panel tracking for user-disabled panels**: `knownPanels` now distinguishes "user deliberately disabled" from "new panel added by an update". First boot seeds with all existing panels; subsequent boots only auto-enable genuinely new ones. Family switch also updates the tracking list.

### Fixed
- **Light preset themes reverting to dark** *(#116)*: `applySchemeVariant()` was not forwarding the dark/light mode to `switchwall.sh`, causing it to fall back to gsettings (typically `prefer-dark`). Light presets with a palette variant active would flash light then immediately revert to dark. All 9 call sites now pass `--mode` explicitly.
- **GameMode panel hiding**: Removed fullscreen counter and hysteresis threshold — auto-detect now directly maps focused-window-fullscreen to GameMode active state. `shouldHidePanels` is always false: auto-detect applies performance optimizations only (disable animations/effects/blur), matching manual mode behavior. Fixes bar and dock disappearing after exiting fullscreen *(#115)*.
- **Angel glass hover/active brightness**: Mix ratios were inverted — `colGlassCardHover` was 70% foreground (blindingly bright), now 12%. `colGlassCardActive` was also 70%, now 22%. Same fix for popup variants. Affects both ii and waffle families.
- **Waffle useMaterial toggle with glass styles**: Removed `effectiveUseMaterial` which forced material colors when glass was active, making the toggle inert for aurora/angel users. Implemented proper 3-path dispatch: material-derived colors, glass Win11 colors with elevated transparency, or flat Win11 colors.
- **Wallpaper selector 100% CPU**: Fullscreen `MultiEffect` blur (blurMax:64 at native resolution) ran every frame while skew view was open. Gated the blur pipeline on `viewMode !== 'skew'` — measured drop from 100% to 0-1% idle.
- **Audio output device switch**: Volume protection guard retained the old sink's state when switching devices, causing false "Illegal increment" errors and volume resets. Protection state and in-flight ramps now reset on sink change.
- **Sidebar placeholder anchoring**: `MaterialPlaceholderMessage` components in AiChat, Anime, and Wallhaven were missing `anchors.fill: parent`.
- **YTMusic mpv process orphaning**: `_stopMpv()` used `signal(15)` which left `running=true`, causing the next `running=true` assignment to no-op and orphan the old mpv process. Switched to `running=false`. Added belt-and-suspenders `pkill` on start, stop, and shutdown. Also fixed exponential title concatenation from MPRIS feedback loop.

### Improved
- **YTMusic UI overhaul**: HoverHandler+TapHandler replaces MouseArea for track items, rounded thumbnail corners, theme-compliant duration badges, compact flat player card layout, audio quality selector (best/medium/low), manual cookies.txt path support, and error messages with stderr hints.
- **Waffle settings visual refresh**: Icons now render inside subtle accent-tinted pill backgrounds. Section headers across all pages gain contextual icons. ~50 generic `desktop` icons replaced with semantically appropriate Fluent icons (eye, shield, pulse, lock, etc.). Search index entries added for GameMode toggles.

## [2.20.0] - 2026-04-11

Community contributions edition. Turns out people actually use this thing and want to make it better. Who knew.

### Added
- **YTMusic "Up Next" notifications** ([@SecArt1](https://github.com/SecArt1)): When a track auto-advances, a transient notification shows what's coming next. Suppressed during gamemode and fullscreen. Configurable via `sidebar.ytmusic.upNextNotifications` and `sidebar.ytmusic.suppressUpNextInFullscreen`. *(PR #111)*
- **Zed editor Go-based theme pipeline** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Zed theming split into its own module (`31-zed.sh`) with a compiled Go generator for significantly faster theme generation. Supports variant-based themes and input signature caching to skip redundant rebuilds. *(PR #98)*
- **Neovim/LazyVim wallpaper theming** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Generates an `aether.nvim` colorscheme plugin that maps Material 3 palette to Neovim highlight groups. Includes file watchers for live hot-reload when colors change. *(PR #103)*
- **Equicord theme support** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): System24 theme generation now discovers Equicord config directories alongside standard Discord client paths. *(PR #100)*

### Fixed
- **Battery info display** ([@orcusforyou](https://github.com/orcusforyou)): Fixed wrong battery percentage and status shown in the Overview dashboard and Control Panel. Turns out displaying the correct number matters. *(PR #95)*
- **Spicetify playback theme refresh** ([@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri)): Playback CSS color blocks now properly rewrite on theme changes instead of going stale. *(PR #101)*
- **YTMusic double-advance race condition**: Fixed a timing bug where the old mpv process exiting during the play-delay window would trigger a second `playNext()`, sending two "Up Next" notifications and skipping a track. The `_userInitiatedPlay` guard now stays active until the new mpv confirms started.
- **Zed theme rebuild detection**: The Go binary now checks timestamps of `main.go`, `common.go`, and `go.mod` before running, preventing a stale binary from silently succeeding and caching the input signature.

### Improved
- **pt-BR translations** ([@Guilherme4Colamarco](https://github.com/Guilherme4Colamarco)): 651 human-written translations replacing auto-generated ones, plus 38 new keys. Fixed broken `%1` format string placeholders that had spaces injected by machine translation. Total coverage: 3435 keys. *(PR #97)*

### Contributors
Shoutout to [@yukazakiri](https://github.com/yukazakiri) for basically adopting the color pipeline this release (4 PRs!), [@SecArt1](https://github.com/SecArt1) for the YTMusic notify feature, [@orcusforyou](https://github.com/orcusforyou) for catching the battery display bug, and [@Guilherme4Colamarco](https://github.com/Guilherme4Colamarco) for making pt-BR speakers not suffer through Google Translate's interpretation of UI strings.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Live update progress**: Setup writes structured progress markers (`progress:STEP:TOTAL:MSG`) during updates. ShellUpdates.qml polls the status file every 2s, parsing step/total/message into reactive properties. UI shows a spinner with step counter (e.g. 3/7) during updates. Watchdog staleness detection prevents infinite timeout on stuck updates.
- **Sidebar drop, swing, and elastic animations**: Three new sidebar open/close animation types in addition to the existing slide/fade/pop/reveal — drop (vertical slide from above with fade), swing (horizontal scale from edge), and elastic (overshoot bounce with scale). Widget stagger animation intensity reduced for subtler startup.
- **YTMusic session resume**: Playback state (URL, position, title, etc.) persisted to config every 5s while playing. On shell restart, the last session is restored automatically if playback was active. New `Config.setNestedValues()` batch function prevents multiple config-change emissions during multi-key writes.
- **WAYLAND_DISPLAY auto-detection**: `apply_qt_runtime_env` now probes `/run/user/<uid>/wayland-*` when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is unset — prevents Qt XCB fallback crash on boot-time systemd starts where the compositor hasn't exported the variable yet. `ensure_systemd_graphical_env` added to the bare `start` code path.
- **Waffle theme settings parity**: Color strength slider, soften colors toggle, and terminal color adjustment sliders (saturation, brightness, harmony, background brightness) with reset button added to WThemesPage — matches ii's ThemesConfig feature set.
- **Waffle font selector widget**: New `WSettingsFontSelector` component — searchable popup over all installed system fonts with featured fonts pinned at top. Used for desktop clock font selection, replacing the previous hardcoded 5-option choice group.

### Changed
- **Dock indicator dots redesign**: Focused dot is now wider (pill shape) with accent color per visual style (angel/inir/aurora/material). Unfocused dots are narrow and dimmed. Fallback dim dot shown for inactive apps when `showAllWindowDots` is off. Config properties hoisted to root for reuse. Vertical-mode anchor overrides removed (unused in current dock modes).
- **Module list sync**: iiShellUpdate added to ii family, iiTilingOverlay moved from waffle shared to ii-only, iiControlPanel removed from waffle shared. Module lists in ModulesConfig.qml synced with shell.qml. DockAppButton pear-desktop app ID updated. `enablePearDesktop` enabled by default.
- **Pear Desktop package detection**: Auto-detect whether `youtube-music` (CachyOS) or `pear-desktop` (AUR) is installed instead of hardcoding one name. CDP port changed from 9222 to 9223 to avoid spicetify conflict.
- **Fresh install defaults**: Material settings UI defaults to overlay mode. Waffle activation watermark enabled by default. Waffle widgets panel slimmed to DateTime + Weather + Media (System, QuickActions, ColorScheme disabled). Wallpaper transition type defaults to random instead of crossfade. Waffle desktop clock font defaults to Roboto Flex.
- **Fresh install packages**: gowall-bin and mission-center added to Arch AUR packages. mission-center added to deps-map for all distros (flatpak fallback). SDDM theme prompt defaults to yes.
- **Waffle background settings order**: Desktop Clock card moved to end of WBackgroundPage — wallpaper controls, effects, and backdrop come first.

### Fixed
- **Dock preview popup stability**: ScriptModel `objectProp` with stable `previewKey` prevents delegate recreation on model rebuild (fixes icon flash). 500ms close grace period prevents popup closure when resizing after closing a window moves the cursor outside bounds. Removed stale `syncVisibleWindows`/`maybeCaptureMissingPreviews` machinery — replaced by simple `onLiveToplevelsChanged` auto-close. Closing animation removed for immediate response.
- **SDDM theme.conf self-heal**: Detects missing `[General]` section or `background=` directive in corrupted theme.conf and restores the canonical template before applying color values.
- **Config bool false values in color pipeline**: jq's `//` operator treats `false` as null, causing `config_bool` to return the fallback instead of the actual `false` value. Uses explicit null check now.
- **Setup flag ordering**: `-y`/`-q` flags moved before the `update` subcommand in the re-exec path so the global parser picks them up. POSIX TTY detection (`[ -t 0 ]`) added as defense-in-depth — non-interactive mode auto-forced when no terminal is attached.
- **GameMode fullscreen detection**: Focused window lookup switched from stale `activeWindow` to `NiriService.windows` array — catches F11 without focus change. Fixed `stateReader.path` where `Qt.resolvedUrl()` on an absolute filesystem path mangled the path, preventing FileView from emitting signals and disabling all detection connections. Input mask across Bar, Dock, VerticalBar, WaffleBar, and Overlay replaced with explicit zero-size emptyMask Item.
- **Systemd KillMode**: Switched from `KillMode=control-group` to `KillMode=process` so apps launched by the shell (mpv, browsers, etc.) survive shell restart.
- **Overview search layout without dashboard**: Workspace grid loader now hides from Column layout during search, preventing vertical centering breakage and results pushed to top of screen.
- **Overview wallpaper without effects**: Workspace thumbnails render unblurred with OpacityMask fallback when `Appearance.effectsEnabled` is false — previously no wallpaper showed at all.
- **Media player selection**: Fixed player selection logic and scroll volume consistency.
- **Waffle dark mode toggle**: Was calling switchwall.sh directly, bypassing MaterialThemeLoader's force-apply gate — preset themes silently ignored mode changes. Now routes through `MaterialThemeLoader.setDarkMode()`.
- **Double palette type regeneration**: Palette type changes in both ii and waffle settings fired switchwall.sh immediately AND through ThemeService's 260ms debounce, causing a race condition. Removed redundant direct calls — ThemeService's `liveRegenSignature` handles auto-theme regeneration automatically.
- **Terminal color adjustment defaults**: ThemesConfig preview and spinbox fallbacks mismatched Config schema — saturation showed 40% instead of 65%, brightness 55% instead of 60%, harmony preview used 0.15 instead of 0.40.
- **Waffle taskbar task manager icon**: Icon name `monitoring` didn't exist in the fluent icon set, rendering blank. Changed to `pulse`.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Systemd shell startup**: Shell startup migrated from niri `spawn-at-startup` to a systemd user service (`inir.service`). Migration 021 handles the transition — removes compositor startup lines, installs and enables the service. `KillMode=process` prevents systemd from terminating child apps on shell restart.
- **CLI discoverability overhaul**: Rich `--help` with dynamic IPC target listing by panel family, per-target `--help`, typo suggestions, function validation. New shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish. IPC registry generated from source with `generate-ipc-registry.py`.
- **Waffle settings redesign**: Complete Fluent-styled redesign of Quick Settings, Background, Themes, Interface, Modules, Bar, Shortcuts, and Waffle Style pages. New shared components: `WSettingsSection`, `WSettingsSlider`, `WSettingsInfoBar`, `WSettingsChoiceGroup`.
- **Gowall wallpaper editor**: New gowall page in waffle settings with theme browser, preview, and apply. Apply routes by active panel family. Shim dir prevents gowall from spawning image viewers after processing.
- **Pear Desktop theming**: New color module (`80-pear-desktop.sh`) with live CSS injection via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Config toggle `enablePearDesktop` with settings UI integration.
- **All-apps grid view**: Grid layout with letter jump strip added to waffle start menu.
- **Overview active-screen-only**: New `overview.activeScreenOnly` config option — shows overview only on the focused monitor in multi-monitor setups.
- **Equicord Discord client support**: Vesktop theme generation now includes `~/.config/equicord/` and `~/.config/Equicord/` paths.

### Changed
- **GameMode rewrite**: Replaced size-based fullscreen heuristic (60px margin) with niri's native `is_fullscreen` flag. New `shouldHidePanels` property — panels only hide when auto-detected AND focused window is fullscreen. Manual GameMode never hides panels. Eliminates false positives on maximized windows with small gaps.
- **Context-aware panel hiding**: Bar, Dock, and VerticalBar use `GameMode.shouldHidePanels` instead of blunt `GameMode.active`. Panels return when user opens Niri overview. Input regions (mask + exclusiveZone) nullified during gamemode to prevent invisible mouse traps.
- **Unified external theming**: Manual preset themes now fan out through the same `applycolor.sh` pipeline as wallpaper auto-generation. 120ms debounced timer ensures FileView flush before script execution. All targets (terminals, editors, chrome, spicetify, steam, pear) stay in sync.
- **GTK/Qt theme overhaul**: Selection colors changed from raw accent to blended surface tones. New hover/active/focus interaction states for buttons, menus, and entries. Added `Colors:Header` section for Darkly. qt6ct/qt5ct config generation hardened.
- **Parallax defaults**: Disabled by default for fresh installs. Zoom values normalized to 1.0 — headroom is now applied internally by the parallax engine.
- **ThemeService family awareness**: Detects `panelFamily` change and re-runs full color pipeline even for manual themes. Waffle wallpaper apply now triggers color regeneration.
- **Terminal color generation**: WCAG contrast-aware tone search prevents low-contrast terminal output. Tone capping prevents whitewash on bright colors. Force-dark terminal mode generates isolated `terminal.json`.
- **Discord theme rename**: Vesktop/midnight themes renamed from `ii-midnight` to `inir-midnight`. Subtler hover/active states, refined mention gradients, softer borders. Legacy CSS auto-cleaned on next color generation.
- **Compact sidebar media**: Redesigned media player and controls cards layout.
- **Bar/dock stale monitor guard**: Screen filter fallback prevents stale monitor names (e.g. after VRR re-enumeration) from hiding all panels.
- **Steam/Pear reload safety**: Removed `pkill` fallbacks for steamwebhelper and youtube-music. Apps are never force-killed — CSS deploys to disk and applies on next app restart.

### Fixed
- **Gowall waffle apply bleeding into ii**: Apply now routes by active panel family and restores waffle color regen.
- **Looks.ensureMinOpacity null guard**: `Qt.color()` returns null, not an invalid object — guard updated.
- **Gowall opening image viewer**: Shim dir with no-op `kitty`/`xdg-open` prevents unwanted window spawns.
- **WaffleWidgets layer**: Changed to `Top` with missing `WButton` import added.
- **Broken fluent icons in WInterfacePage**: Missing `WButton` import restored.
- **Glass opacity floor**: Enforced minimum for waffle aurora/angel surfaces.
- **Overview vertical centering**: Replaced anchor-based centering with calculated `topMargin` approach to prevent subpixel blur and erratic positioning.
- **Volume OSD on gamemode activation**: Prevented spurious OSD trigger during gamemode state change.
- **Slider handle-track desync**: Fixed during drag interaction, added tabular numbers for consistent width.
- **Parallax sizing and crossfader artifacts**: Reworked transition logic and hardened skew selector sync.
- **Click-outside backdrops**: Declarative visibility prevents orphaned input capture layers.
- **Niri output key rejection**: Compositor settings backend now rejects unsupported output keys.
- **Volume controls after output switch**: Fixed, with easyeffects crash avoidance.
- **Alacritty migration**: Hoisted misplaced `live_config_reload` key.
- **Duplicate inir instances**: Guard on `inir run`, kill foreground wrappers on stop, loop `qs kill` for multi-instance cleanup.
- **Foot terminal colors**: Switched to `[colors-dark]` section to drop deprecation spam.
- **Keyboard layout save key**: Fixed save path, stopped language fallback to `en_US`.
- **Theme regen consistency**: Aligned regeneration across settings, family switch, and external targets.
- **Preset theme color propagation**: Fixed propagation to external apps and family switch regen.
- **Fullscreen surface handling**: Unmap all shell surfaces during fullscreen for direct scanout.
### Removed
- **`overview.centerLauncher`**: Config option removed — overview always uses calculated vertical centering.
- **`spawn-at-startup` compositor entry**: Shell startup ownership moved to systemd user service.

## [2.17.4] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Complete Internationalization**: 14 new languages fully translated with 3400+ keys each (es_AR, fr_FR, de_DE, it_IT, pt_BR, ru_RU, uk_UA, hi_IN, ar_SA, he_HE, zh_CN, ja_JP, ko_KR, vi_VN).
- **Translation Auto-Updater**: Added `translations/tools/auto-translate.js` script to bulk translate missing keys via Google Translate API without hitting limits.

### Changed
- **Bug Report Template**: Updated GitHub issue templates to require explicit Qt, Quickshell, and Distro version fields for better debugging.

### Fixed
- **Niri Display Config State**: Fixed combo box bindings breaking after user interaction. State is now imperatively resynced after output data refreshes, and reads are deferred by 300ms to avoid stale values.
- **Settings Status Banner UI**: Improved the error/info status banner in NiriConfig with distinct colors (error/primary), larger icons, and solid-styled Dismiss/Retry buttons.

## [2.17.3] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Configurable sidebar animations**: Sidebars now support 4 animation types — slide (default), fade, pop, and reveal — selectable from Settings > Panels. Uses Material Design motion tokens with enter/exit transitions.
- **Lock screen video/GIF support**: Video and animated GIF wallpapers now render on the lock screen with first-frame fallback. Animation is off by default (Settings > Lock Screen toggle). Supports both ii and waffle families including the Niri-safe variant.

### Fixed
- **YTMusic track selection race**: Clicking a song while another was playing could advance to the next track instead of the selected one. Added `_userInitiatedPlay` guard to suppress spurious `playNext()` from the old mpv's exit handler during the 200ms handoff window.
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle misalignment**: WARP toggle in the classic quick panel broke grid alignment because its `contentItem` lacked the Item wrapper other toggles use.
- **Classic quick toggles left-aligned in compact mode**: Grid was anchored to left/right edges in compact mode instead of centering. Now always horizontally centered.
- **Waffle lock screen GIF detection**: `wallpaperIsVideo`/`wallpaperIsGif` were checking the thumbnail-resolved path instead of the raw source path, which could miss animated wallpapers when a thumbnail was set.

## [2.17.2] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Arch dependency tracker meta-package**: New `inir-deps` package registered during setup so pacman orphan cleanup does not remove iNiR runtime dependencies.
- **Post-install extras flow**: `./setup extras` now exposes optional installs for iNiR-Walls and ii-pixel-sddm after initial setup.
- **Curated software catalog sidebar tab**: Added software discovery surface with bundled catalog data and AppCatalog service wiring.
- **Material background clock controls**: Added full clock customization for the ii background widget (schema/defaults/settings + widget surfaces).

### Changed
- **Arch install hardening**: Dependency install flow now handles known Noctalia package conflicts before iNiR package resolution.
- **Path model normalization**: Runtime/services/settings/welcome surfaces now consume centralized XDG-derived paths from `Directories.qml` instead of scattered literals.
- **Setup UX flow**: Fresh install keeps optional content opt-in (SDDM/iNiR-Walls), update path handling and theme actions were hardened, and the setup TUI received the new Ink visual refactor.
- **README localization refresh**: Main README and localized docs/readme pages were rewritten/synced for current project messaging.
- **Technical docs sync**: IPC, theming, package, and project-map docs were aligned with real runtime/distribution behavior.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper status resolution**: Setup now reads `theme-meta.json` via `.wallpaper` with `.source_path` fallback so active wallpaper no longer shows as `none` when metadata uses source-path shape.
- **iNiR-Walls feedback**: Extras flow now shows visible clone/download progress and no longer suppresses user-facing install logs.
- **Theming target wiring**: Spicetify target config key corrected to `appearance.wallpaperTheming.enableSpicetify`, and terminal theming applies with safer terminal ancestry detection.
- **Runtime interaction edge cases**: Cheatsheet key handling and wallpaper coverflow monitor targeting/cleanup were corrected for more reliable focus and close behavior.
- **YTMusic playback/state reliability**: Fixed media source switching sync and autoplay recovery when mpv hangs at EOF.
- **Background media widget blur placement**: Corrected half-pixel placement artifact that caused blur instability.
- **Settings/overlay alignment polish**: Fixed variable-width action tab underline alignment, removed settings nav scrollbar rail bleed, and prevented overlay-mode hover bubble from shifting nav alignment.
- **Anime schedule watch fallback**: Migrated fallback target to 9animetv for broken/legacy watch links.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SDDM session popup selector**: Session switcher on the login screen now opens a popup list instead of blindly cycling through entries.
- **CLI command forwarding**: `inir config`, `inir info`, `inir backup`, and `inir logs` forwarded through the launcher to the setup TUI.
- **TUI library expansion**: Rich chooser menus, task progress tracker, key-value detail views, and section helpers for setup subcommands.

### Fixed
- **Dock/taskbar icon resolution**: Reverse-lookup maps in AppSearch match Electron, AppImage, and reverse-domain window IDs to their desktop entries (#105).
- **Backdrop hideWallpaper gate**: `hideWallpaper` now respects `backdrop.enable` instead of firing unconditionally (#104).
- **Repo-link version detection**: `get_installed_version()` and `get_installed_commit()` return live git state for repo-link installs instead of stale `version.json`.
- **Migration 009 modular config**: Handles both monolithic `config.kdl` and post-018 `config.d/40-environment.kdl` layouts for the dbus log spam fix.
- **SDDM theme idempotent copy**: Checksum comparison skips the copy when source and target are already identical.

### Changed
- **PKGBUILD optdepends**: Added `gowall-bin` and `nm-connection-editor`; synced `.SRCINFO`.

### Removed
- **CI workflow**: GitHub Actions workflow removed — not viable on current repo plan.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Shell entry animation**: Panels slide in on startup with a 400ms delay, and hide during wallpaper coverflow transitions for a cleaner visual flow.
- **Family transition overlay**: Snapshotted color preservation during panel family switches, native iNiR logo, and cleaner Material Design text styling.
- **Steam theming rewrite**: Template-based pipeline with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) live injection replaces the old Adwaita for Steam approach. Includes visual quality overhaul and real-time color updates.
- **Python-only color pipeline**: Unified Material You color generation using pure Python, removing the external `matugen` binary dependency entirely.
- **MaterialPlaceholderMessage widget**: New M3-style empty-state component replaces `PagePlaceholder` across 17 modules for consistent placeholder messaging.
- **Version divergence warning**: `inir` CLI warns when installed code version doesn't match the running runtime, preventing stale-code confusion after updates.
- **Config directory compatibility layer**: Transparent bridge for the legacy config path, easing future migration without breaking existing setups.
- **v1→v2 manifest upgrade protection**: `setup update` detects and preserves user modifications to runtime files when upgrading manifest versions.
- **Wallpaper selector rewrite**: Skew view rebuilt with blur backdrop overlay, refined exit animation, and shell panel hiding during selection.
- **Alt-tab switcher improvements**: Responsive geometry adapting to window count, Vim-style keybindings (`hjkl`), and `Shape` drop shadows.
- **Control panel enhancements**: State-driven open/close animations, compact mode, and config-driven section visibility.
- **Color strength and accent color config**: Extended schema with `color-strength` and `accent-color` options for finer theming control.
- **Scheme variant control**: Material scheme variant (Content, Expressive, Fidelity, etc.) selection wired into QML theme services.
- **Waffle display scaling**: `dp()` function applied across waffle panel layout dimensions for DPI-aware sizing.
- **CI, code of conduct, and security policy**: GitHub Actions workflow, community standards, and vulnerability reporting process.

### Changed
- **INIR_VENV rename**: Environment variable `ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV` renamed to `INIR_VENV` across all scripts and services (migration 020).
- **Auto scheme detection tuning**: Expressive and Rainbow scheme variants are now much rarer in automatic selection, favoring more predictable palettes.
- **Spotify behavior**: Minimize to tray instead of close; moves to workspace 99 on shell exit to preserve session.
- **Dual-path PopupToolTip**: Tooltip system refactored for both inline and popup rendering paths with migrations across consumers.
- **GTK/KDE/Qt external app theming**: Enhanced template rendering for GTK3/4, KDE kdeglobals, and Qt Darkly color schemes.
- **README and CONTRIBUTING rewrite**: Documentation refreshed for clarity and accuracy.
- **Shebang standardization**: All shell scripts use consistent `#!/usr/bin/env bash` with project-wide shellcheck configuration.
- **iceicerice legacy backend removed**: Old theming backend fully excised in favor of the unified Python pipeline.

### Fixed

- **Waffle Looks.qml**: Danger/warning colors derived from Material tokens instead of hardcoded values.
- **Color pipeline improvements**: GTK theme application, terminal config generation, material color generation, and Kvantum theming all refined.
- **Launcher restart flow**: `start_background()` uses nohup for proper process detachment; restart via `inir start` instead of direct `qs` exec.

### Fixed
- **Settings direct mutations**: Converted legacy `Config.options` property assignments to `Config.setNestedValue()` in InterfaceConfig (overlay, crosshair, dock settings) and Translator (language persistence).
- **ThumbnailImage path resolution**: Fixed non-absolute path handling and improved URI encoding compliance for thumbnail cache lookup.
- **Scheme variant on manual themes**: Settings pages now use `MaterialThemeLoader.applySchemeVariant()` with seed color for non-auto themes instead of only running `switchwall.sh`.
- **Distribution scripts**: `robust-update.sh`, `snapshots.sh`, and `uninstall.sh` use path-based `qs -p` targeting consistent with the launcher.
- **Super overview daemon**: PID detection matches both legacy `qs -c inir` and path-based `qs -p <path>` process forms.

- **Modular Niri config**: Default Niri configuration split into `config.d/` fragments (input, layout, window-rules, environment, startup, animations, binds, layer-rules, user-extra).
- **Migration 016**: Converts legacy `qs`/`ii`-era Niri keybindings to the `inir` launcher.
- **Migration 017**: Deduplicates hardware keybinds (brightness/media) that accumulated from prior migration bugs.
- **Migration 018**: Automatically splits monolithic Niri configs into the modular `config.d/` layout.

### Changed
- **Dark mode toggles**: Routed through `MaterialThemeLoader` to ensure a reliable `colors.json` reload after switching.
- **Style selection**: No longer forces `appearance.transparency.enable` when selecting styles.
- **Color system modularized**: `applycolor.sh` rewritten from monolithic script to modular dispatcher with individual modules (terminals, GTK, Qt, Spicetify, SDDM) and shared runtime library.
- **Shell RC namespace**: Setup-managed shell integration files moved from `~/.config/ii/` to `~/.config/inir/`; existing RC includes are migrated in place.
- **Setup behavior for packaged installs**: `setup status`, `setup update`, `setup rollback`, and `setup uninstall` now detect externally-managed installs and provide appropriate guidance instead of assuming repo-based updates.
- **Shell lifecycle commands**: Internal kill/restart/IPC flows use path-based `qs -p <path>` targeting instead of config-name-based `qs -c inir`.
- **Alt-Switcher refactor**: Major refactoring of both ii and waffle alt-switcher components with expanded configuration options.
- **Niri keybinds documentation**: Complete rewrite of `docs/KEYBINDS.md`.

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare WARP toggle**: Periodic status polling to stay in sync.

### Changed
- **Wallpaper selector split**: "Change Wallpaper" action now explicitly labeled as Grid or Coverflow, each closing the other before opening.
- **AUR badge theming**: Replaced hardcoded `#1793d1` color with `Appearance.colors.colPrimary` / `Appearance.inir.colPrimary` tokens for proper style-aware rendering.
- **System update action**: Now auto-detects yay/paru/pacman instead of using a hardcoded command.

### Fixed
- **iNiR style icon**: Replaced invalid "spark" Material Symbol with "terminal" for the Style: iNiR action.
- **Left/Right arrows in search input**: Removed Left/Right arrow key interception from SearchBar to prevent conflict with text cursor movement. Category cycling from search now uses Tab/Shift+Tab only; Left/Right remain available from the action list delegates where there is no text cursor conflict.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Backdrop wallpaper transitions**: Both ii and waffle backdrops now use `WallpaperCrossfader` for smooth wallpaper transition animations matching their workspace counterparts.
- **Animated blur toggle**: New `enableAnimatedBlur` config key for GIF/video wallpapers in both families.
- **Blur transition suppression**: Blur fades out before wallpaper transitions so the change is visible even with windows open, then fades back in after transition completes.
- **Waffle backdrop effects controls**: Vignette, saturation, contrast, and animated blur controls added to waffle backdrop settings.
- **Waffle transition config**: Independent transition settings for waffle wallpapers (`waffles.background.transition`).
- **Spicetify wallpaper theming**: Opt-in Material You color scheme for Spotify via Spicetify with live watch mode — colors update on wallpaper change without restarting Spotify (PR #80 by @yukazakiri).
- **Migration 013**: Auto-patch kde-material-you-colors wrapper on update.
- **Migration 014**: Malloc arena optimization (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`, `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072`) for reduced glibc memory overhead.
- **Migration 015**: Clean orphan config keys (`blurStatic`, `videoBlurStrength` → `thumbnailBlurStrength`) from existing user configs.

### Changed
- **Blur decoupled from awww renderer**: Blur now reads from the crossfader texture regardless of who renders the visible wallpaper, fixing blur not working when parallax is disabled.
- **blurStatic removed**: Blur only activates when windows are present on the workspace. The always-on `blurStatic` option caused rendering issues in both families and has been removed.
- **videoBlurStrength → thumbnailBlurStrength**: Renamed for clarity; migration preserves user values.
- **Saturation/contrast defaults**: Changed from 1.0 to 0 (neutral) for new installs. Existing users keep their values.
- **Backend provider hardcoded**: `awww` backend is now always active (config key ignored, no UI change).
- **Settings surfaces refreshed**: Updated quick options, control panel, and shell surfaces.

### Fixed
- **Wallpaper double-apply**: Prevent duplicate `switchwall.sh` runs with `_applyInProgress` suppression flag and 3-second timer.
- **kde-material-you-colors stacking**: Kill previous daemon instance before launching new one to prevent orphan processes.
- **StyledListView animations**: Use `Transition.enabled` instead of `running` on child animations to prevent animation glitches.
- **Blur alignment**: Reverted `sourceSize÷4` to screen resolution for correct blur positioning.
- **Blur source loading**: Keep wallpaper source always loaded to avoid style-switch freeze.
- **Todo.qml runtime error**: Replaced invalid `Process.exec` with `Quickshell.execDetached`.
- **Config schema sync**: Added `enableOpenCode`, `vscodeEditors` (14 editor forks), and `omp` (oh-my-posh) to schema and defaults — keys existed in theming scripts but were missing from Config.qml.
- **Kitty tab bar colors**: Update live via SIGUSR1 and atomic symlink swap.
- **WaffleConfig stale reference**: Removed UI control for deleted `blurStatic` config key.

### Performance
- **Animation instances**: Replaced 402 `createObject` calls with inline `Animation` instances, eliminating per-animation QObject allocation overhead.
- **Blur GPU gating**: Style-gated `layer.enabled` and `source` on all blur Images — GPU blur work only runs when the active style uses it. Reduced `blurMax` from 100 to 64.
- **Wallpaper caching**: `cache:false` on all wallpaper Images across both families with `sourceSize` constraints to cap decoded pixmap resolution.
- **Thumbnail caching**: Skip `magick` subprocess when thumbnail is already loaded; cache `magick identify` results.
- **Crossfader optimization**: `cache:false` on crossfader slots, release inactive slot texture after transition completes.
- **ColorQuantizer gating**: Only run wallpaper ColorQuantizer when aurora/angel style is active.

- **Bar context menu positioning**: Vertical bar popup opens toward screen center (right when bar is left, left when bar is right) following the dock pattern; horizontal bar popup opens above when bar is at bottom, below when at top
- **Desktop context menu close behavior**: Left-click on desktop closes the menu; right-click repositions it — avoids layer-shell backdrop conflict on Niri

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Multi-monitor wallpaper support**: Per-monitor wallpaper and backdrop paths via WallpaperListener service
- **Video first-frame system**: Automatic ffmpeg extraction and caching of first-frame JPGs for video wallpapers
- **Per-monitor aurora/glass**: Bar, dock, and sidebars use per-screen wallpaper for blur and color quantization
- **Wallpaper selector multi-monitor targeting**: Auto-detects focused monitor, opens on target screen, per-monitor selection
- **Per-monitor backdrop paths**: Each monitor can have its own backdrop wallpaper independent of global setting
- **Derive theme colors from backdrop**: New toggle in settings — all color generation sources (matugen, ColorQuantizer, aurora) switch to backdrop wallpaper when enabled
- **Card right-click swap**: Right-click on the front card toggles between main wallpaper and backdrop views
- **Backdrop card focus borders**: Selection border overlay when backdrop card is in front and selected
- **DockPreview toplevel reactivity**: Auto-close preview when app exits, update on toplevel changes
- **Per-monitor random wallpapers**: Random wallpaper scripts (konachan, osu) support focused monitor targeting

### Changed
- **Card clipping**: Parent-level `layer.enabled + OpacityMask` replaces per-image masking — all children (gradients, labels, badges) now properly clip to rounded corners
- **Card scaling quality**: `layer.smooth` on scaled cards for sharper text and badges when zoomed out
- **Video/GIF display**: Always load AnimatedImage for GIFs (frozen when animation disabled); replaced QtMultimedia Video with first-frame Image in previews
- **Color pipeline**: ColorQuantizer and effectiveWallpaperUrl return image-safe sources for videos (first-frame cache → config thumbnail → trigger generation)
- **switchwall.sh**: Per-monitor wallpaper changes skip global color regeneration; `--noswitch` reads current wallpaper from config
- **CryptoWidget**: Cache staleness check — only refresh if older than refreshInterval (default 300s)
- **WaffleConfig**: Use `Config.setNestedValue()` instead of direct property mutation

### Fixed
- **Black peaks on cards**: Gradient and label overlays no longer escape rounded corners (`clip:true` only clips rectangular)
- **Aurora colors for video wallpapers**: ColorQuantizer receives first-frame images instead of undecoded video URLs
- **Backdrop changes all monitors**: Per-monitor backdrop selection now only affects the selected monitor
- **White line above wallpaper path**: Removed hardcoded separator — `Layout.topMargin` provides sufficient spacing
- **Derive theme colors noop**: Toggle now wires through to Appearance.qml ColorQuantizer, Wallpapers.effectiveWallpaperPath, and switchwall.sh matugen source

- **Settings bugs**: Fixed BarConfig layout property name, WaffleConfig bindings and spacing
- **YtMusic persistence**: Connection state and resolvedBrowserArg now persist across restarts
- **YtMusic cookies**: Always use --cookies-from-browser instead of intermediate cookie files, resolve Firefox fork profile paths

### Fixed
- **Media player duplication**: Bottom overlay now uses `displayPlayers` with title/position dedup, matching bar popup behavior
- **Notification popup animations**: Differentiated popup vs sidebar behavior — popups use instant height changes to avoid Wayland resize stair-stepping, with height buffer and clip to prevent content overflow
- **Hardcoded animations**: Replaced raw `NumberAnimation`/`ColorAnimation` with `Appearance.animation` and `Looks.transition` design tokens across TimerIndicator, KeyboardKey, BarMediaPlayerItem, ThemePresetCard, TilingOverlay, and WidgetsContent
- **Screen cast settings**: Added null safety, `setNestedValue` for output field, synced defaults with Config.qml schema
- **Shell updates**: Prevented double repository search fallback when version.json exists but lacks `repo_path`
